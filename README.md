I'd be happy to help you compile and provide a sample code structure for performing market basket analysis using Python. However, the code can be quite extensive and may vary depending on your specific dataset and requirements. I'll provide a high-level structure that you can use as a starting point. You'll need to adapt and expand upon it based on your data and analysis needs.

Here's a simplified example of the code structure for market basket analysis:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
# Load your transaction data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')

# Perform data preprocessing, such as one-hot encoding
basket = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['item'])

# Step 2: Perform Market Basket Analysis
# Calculate item frequencies (support)
frequent_itemsets = apriori(basket, min_support=0.05, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1.0)

# Step 3: Display or save the results
# Display association rules
print(rules)

# Save the rules to a CSV file
rules.to_csv('association_rules.csv', index=False)
```

In this code, you'll need to:

1. Import the necessary libraries, such as pandas and mlxtend.
2. Load your transaction data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Perform data preprocessing, which may include one-hot encoding or other necessary transformations.
4. Use the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
5. Specify the minimum support and other rule metrics based on your business needs.
6. Display or save the association rules for further analysis.

Make sure you install the required libraries like pandas and mlxtend using pip or conda.

This is just a basic example, and you may need to customize it according to your specific data and analysis goals. Additionally, you might want to consider scaling up your analysis for large datasets and optimizing your code for better performance.
